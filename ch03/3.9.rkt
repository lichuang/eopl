Exercise 3.9 [**] Add list processing operations to the language, including cons, car, cdr, null? 
  and emptylist. A list should be able to contain any expressed value, including another list. 
  Give the deÔ¨Ånitions of the expressed and denoted values of the language, as in section 3.2.2. 
  For example,

    let x = 4
    in cons(x,
      cons(cons(-(x,1), emptylist), emptylist))

  should return an expressed value that represents the list (4 (3)).
