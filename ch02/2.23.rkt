Exercise 2.23 [*] The deﬁnition of lc-exp ignores the condition in deﬁnition 1.1.8 that says 
  “Identiﬁer is any symbol other than lambda.” Modify the deﬁnition of identifier? 
  to capture this condition. As a hint, remember that any predicate can be used in define-datatype, 
  even ones you deﬁne.
